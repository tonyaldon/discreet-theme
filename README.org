* About

This repository provides two versions close to my theme
[[https://github.com/tonyaldon/emacs.d/blob/master/themes/discreet-theme.el][discreet-theme.el]] I'm using within emacs.

One is to be used with [[http://highlightjs.org][Highlight.js]] and the other with [[https://pygments.org/][Pygments]].

* Motivation

There already exists cool dark themes out there for highlightjs (see
[[https://highlightjs.org/static/demo/][highlightjs demo]]), but for concistency I wanted the one I'm using
everyday within emacs.

* Install
** with Highlight.js

1. Copy the file [[./discreet-theme.css]] in your project.

2. Include the file ~discreet-theme.css~ in your html file and turn on
   highlightjs by adding these snippet the ~<head>~ tag:

   #+BEGIN_SRC html
   <link rel="stylesheet" href="discreet-theme.css">
   <script src="//cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/highlight.js/10.1.1/highlight.min.js"></script>
   <script>hljs.initHighlightingOnLoad();</script>
   #+END_SRC

** with Pygments

If the code snippets you want to highlight has been generated with
Pygments either from ~python~ or with the command lines ~pygmentize~,
put the file [[./discreet-theme-pygments.css]] in your project and include
it in your html file by adding the following line the ~<head>~ tag:

#+BEGIN_SRC html
<link rel="stylesheet" href="discreet-theme-pygments.css">
#+END_SRC

* Dev

The ~dev/public/index.html~ contains some chunks of code (~bash~,
~html~, ~css~, ~javascript~, ~python~) and can be serve as static
files with ~express~. To do so, follow the 3 steps below.

1. Install dev depencies by running the command:

   : npm install

2. Serve the app and watch the files by running the command:

   : npm run dev

3. Open the ~index.html~ in your browser at the url ~localhost:3000/index.html~.
